# tabbed-browser
Creating a tabbed browser using PyQt5.
Web browser is an application used to access and view websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the screen.
Tabbing : Adding tabs complicates the internals of the browser a bit, since there will now need to keep track of the currently active browser view, both to update UI elements (URL bar) to changing state in the currently active window and to ensure the UI events are dispatched to the correct web view.
PyQt5 is cross-platform GUI toolkit, a set of python bindings for Qt v5. One can develop an interactive desktop application with so much ease because of the tools and simplicity provided by this library.
